                <p>
                  <b>Q: Where is all this taking place?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> At <a href="http://bayards.com">Bayard's</a> in Hanover Square.<br>
                  1 Hanover Square<br>
                  New York, NY 10004
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: What time?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> The processional will start promptly at 6, so please arrive at the zoo by 5:30 to ensure you have plenty of time to find the ceremony location, get to your seat, etc. Cocktails are at 7, and dinner starts at 8. Party ends at midnight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: How should I get there?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> A few options...<br>
                  1) Bayard's is within walking distance of Take our buses, which will depart from the Eventi Hotel at 4:00pm.<br>
                  2) Drive: Plan to park in the Southern Boulevard lot, which is near the intersection of Southern Boulevard and East 182nd Street.<br>
                  3) Take a cab or car service and instruct them to drop you off at the Southern Boulevard entrance, 2300 Southern Boulevard.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: It&rsquo;s New York City! Can&rsquo;t I just take the subway?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> NO! Please don&rsquo;t. The subway-accessible entrance will be closed when you arrive, and you&rsquo;ll be left wandering around the Bronx trying to get to the only open entrance. Not safe, not fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: If I&rsquo;m taking the bus, am I stuck at the zoo until midnight, or can I leave early?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> You&rsquo;re not stuck! If you would like to leave early, please simply find our coordinators and they will call you a car service. You&rsquo;ll probably be able to tell who they are, but if you can&rsquo;t, look for the friendly-looking people carrying notebooks, clipboards or iPads. (It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that you&rsquo;ll catch a cab in this neighborhood, so please do call a car and don&rsquo;t leave it to chance.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: What should I wear?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> Hmm... let&rsquo;s call it cocktail attire. No jeans, t-shirts or sneakers, but tuxes and ballgowns aren&rsquo;t necessary either. Suits and nice dresses (or saris!) are more than fine. Ladies, please consider bringing a sweater or shawl in case it&rsquo;s chilly during our outdoor ceremony. And bring your dancin&rsquo; shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: I want to bring some special surprise handmade confetti! That&rsquo;s cool, right?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> No! Sorry, zoo rules state that none of the following is allowed: balloons, sporting balls, skateboards, bicycles, tiki torches, confetti, glitter, rollerblades, scooters, moon walkers or non-zoo-residing animals (except for service animals).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: I&rsquo;m getting you a gigantic present! Should I just bring it to the wedding?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> Wow, thank you! We would really appreciate it if you could have gifts shipped directly to our home, since it&rsquo;ll be a little complicated transporting things from the wedding to our place. Shipping information is already set up on our registries. If you would like to get us something that we haven&rsquo;t registered for, feel free to reach out (maltbywedding@gmail.com) and we&rsquo;ll provide you with the info. (Though please keep in mind that we live in a small NYC apartment, so space for gigantic presents is limited!) 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: Is it all right if I bring my kids?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> Yes, but if your child is old enough to need his or her own seat, please make sure you have R.S.V.P.&rsquo;d for him or her. We need to make sure we account for the little ones in our seating chart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: Ack, I can&rsquo;t remember whether I&rsquo;ve R.S.V.P.&rsquo;d or not!</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> We&rsquo;d rather have too much information than not enough. Go ahead and fill out the form <a href="#rsvp" target="_blank">here</a>, and if it&rsquo;s a duplicate, we&rsquo;ll get rid of it, no problemo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: I may need a little help getting around.</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> Don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; the zoo provides golf carts to help transport anyone who&rsquo;s elderly, injured or otherwise could use assistance. The walk from the parking lot to the ceremony is short, but if you would like help, just tell the coordinator who greets you at the entrance. You&rsquo;ll probably be able to tell who the coordinators are, but if you can&rsquo;t, look for the friendly-looking people carrying notebooks, clipboards or iPads. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: What if I haven&rsquo;t gotten my fill of quality Akshay and Anna time by midnight?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> Join us for late night, post-wedding karaoke once everyone&rsquo;s back in Midtown (ask a bridesmaid or groomsman at the wedding for details). And even if you&rsquo;re not a night owl, plan to meet us for a casual picnic lunch the next day, Sunday 9/30. If the weather is nice, you will find us in Madison Square Park, which is close to the hotels, starting at around 1:00pm. Grab food at Pret a Manger, Starbucks, Chipotle, Shake Shack (our favorite!) or anywhere else nearby and bring it to the park. If the weather is crummy, meet us at Beer Authority (300 W 40th Street, at 8th Avenue) at 1:00pm. If the weather is questionable and you are not sure where to go, check Anna&rsquo;s twitter account: <a href="http://twitter.com/amalt">twitter.com/amalt</a> &mdash; she will post the game plan there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: I&rsquo;m arriving Friday 9/28. What am I supposed to do with myself?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> We put together <a href="https://foursquare.com/harryh/list/things-to-do-in-nyc">a list of some of our favorite places in NYC</a>, so check them out! Also, join us Friday evening at around 7:30 or 8:00 for a drink or two at The Archive (12 East 36th St, between Fifth and Madison). We will be in the back. Just don&rsquo;t let us stay out late &mdash; we need our beauty sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: Is there anything I can do to help you guys out on the big day?</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> You&rsquo;re too kind! A couple of ideas: If you have a Flip cam (or lots of storage on your iPhone), we&rsquo;d love to get a little video footage of the ceremony, etc. A friend will be doing an &ldquo;official&rdquo; video, but it&rsquo;ll be fun to see things from your perspective, too! You&rsquo;re also more than welcome to take photos, but do us a huge favor and don&rsquo;t leave your seat during the ceremony to take them. Our photographers are in charge, so please let them do their thing. Other than that, just relax and have fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Q: My question isn&rsquo;t covered here. Help!</b><br>
                  <b>A:</b> No problem: Just email <a href="mailto:harryh@gmail.com">harryh@gmail.com</a> and we&rsquo;ll get right back to you.
